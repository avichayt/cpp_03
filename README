size = 50:

Answers:
The Eigen Library is superior :(.
Both are faster when manipulating 50 size vs 500 size.
Both do better when adding vs when multiplying, because adding is o(N^2) vs multiplying which
is at least O(N^2.3). Eigen probably uses much better algorithms than the O(N^3) we use.
And last, the differences between the data sets shouldn't be that a change, but can make
a difference if multiplying random numbers takes more time.
